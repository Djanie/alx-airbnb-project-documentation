## Airbnb Clone User Stories  
Based on the Airbnb Clone backend use cases, here are five user stories capturing core interactions:

As a user, I want to register an account so that I can access the platform as a guest, host, or admin.
As a host, I want to create and manage property listings so that guests can book them.
As a guest, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can reserve a stay.
As a guest, I want to submit a review and rating for a property so that I can share my experience.
As an admin, I want to monitor and manage bookings so that I can resolve disputes or cancel invalid bookings.
